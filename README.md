# Project Dino - massive scale load tests from AWS Lambda

## Note

ü¶ñ **Dino was an experiment and is no longer maintained.**

‚ÑπÔ∏è [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/) has built-in support for scaling out tests on AWS Lambda or AWS Fargate now.

## Usage

Set up an IAM user and a role first and add the credentials to `~/.aws/credentials` under `[dino]`. Then run:

```
$ npm install -g artillery-dino
$ AWS_PROFILE=dino dino setup
$ AWS_PROFILE=dino dino -n 500 -c 10 -l 20 -t http://dev.myapp.io/
```
