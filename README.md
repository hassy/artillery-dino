# Project Dino - massive scale load tests from AWS Lambda

## Note

ü¶ñ **Dino was an experiment and is no longer maintained.**

‚ÑπÔ∏è [Artillery Pro](https://artillery.io/pro) provides distributed large scale testing (including a [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) based serverless backend).

## Usage

Set up an IAM user and a role first and add the credentials to `~/.aws/credentials` under `[dino]`. Then run:

```
$ npm install -g artillery-dino
$ AWS_PROFILE=dino dino setup
$ AWS_PROFILE=dino dino -n 500 -c 10 -l 20 -t http://dev.myapp.io/
```
